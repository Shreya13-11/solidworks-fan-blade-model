# SolidWorks Fan Blade Model

This repository contains a 3D model of a fan blade created in SolidWorks

The design focuses on understanding:
- revolved boss feature
- sketch dimensions and constraints
- blade shaping using profiles
- smooth transitions using fillets

No assembly is included — this is a single part model.

## 🔧 Modeling Process (Summary)

### 1️⃣ Revolved Base
A profile was sketched and then revolved 360° to create the main hub shape.

Key dimensions used (from tutorial):
- Length ≈ 350 mm
- Front radius dome
- Revolve angle: 360°

### 2️⃣ Blade Sketch
A second sketch was created on a side plane to define the blade profile.

Important constraints included:
- Tangent curves
- Defined lengths
- Angle for blade twist
- Fully defined sketches

### 3️⃣ Blade Formation
Features such as loft / cut / fillet were applied to shape the blade smoothly.
